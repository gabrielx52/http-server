Code 401 Python http server package
## Michael Shinners and Gabriel Meringolo


### echo: 
Created an echo server that will echo back input messages with testing.

### step1: 
Added response ok and error functions with testing. Will return 200 or 500 HTTP status code header responses.

### step2: 
Added parse_request function to check for valid requests. Will send appropriate response with status code. Paramaterized response error function. Ford assisted by suggesting the codecs lib to help with encode/decode issues.
